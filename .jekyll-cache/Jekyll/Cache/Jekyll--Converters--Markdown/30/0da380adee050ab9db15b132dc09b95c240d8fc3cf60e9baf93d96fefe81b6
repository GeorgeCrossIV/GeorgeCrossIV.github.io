<p>My name is George Cross and I am lifelong learner who is dedicated to honorable achievement in every endeavor that I embark. I have varied interests and I attempt to be a Jack of all trades; however, I do attempt to master some. I have a passion for providing solutions to problems.</p>

<p>I have over thirty years’ experience in the information technology field. I currently work for DataStax, which sells an open source distributed database based on Apache Cassandra. I’ve also worked at the following companies:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Dun &amp; Bradstreet (Data Engineer, Senior Engagement Manager)</li>
  <li>Microsoft (Director Business Development, Architect, Solution Engineer)</li>
  <li>Avande (Director)</li>
  <li>IBM (Architect)</li>
  <li>Unisys (Practice Director)</li>
  <li>Temple University (Assistant Director)</li>
  <li>GDIT (Database Expert)</li>
  <li>All About The Data [AATD] (Chief Technical Advisor)</li>
</ul>

<p>I worked for Dun &amp; Bradstreet’s Government division as a Data Engineer and Senior Engagement Manager. I worked for IBM as an architect in technical sales, Microsoft for nine years, Unisys for four years, GDIT for two years, Temple University for five years and Avanade for two years. I’m very passionate about my work with All About The Data (AATD, LLC). I’ve had many different roles that have taken me to forty-three states and eleven countries.</p>

<p>I’ve been involved with big data for many years. In 1998, I worked on a 2TB data warehouse solution for Microsoft, which at the time was one of the largest data warehouses not on a mainframe – an example of high volume. I’ve worked on a 99.999% high availability solution for NASDAQ that offloaded quotes from the mainframe to WinTel server – example of high velocity.</p>

<p>I’m an expert on Microsoft’s application platform technologies (SQL Server, Visual Studio, Azure). I’m have intermediate knowledge in Oracle’s and IBM’s database technologies. I’m also have intermediate expertise in big data technologies such as Apache Cassandra and Apache Hadoop. I am knowledgeable in several other database technologies such as Postgres. I hold the following certifications:</p>
<ul>
  <li>MCDBA – Microsoft certified database administrator</li>
  <li>MCSE – Microsoft certified system engineer</li>
  <li>MCSD – Microsoft certified solution developer (VB &amp; C#)</li>
  <li>Microsoft Specialist – Azure</li>
  <li>AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate</li>
</ul>
