<p>Iâ€™ve been involved with big data for many years. In 1998, I worked on a 2TB data warehouse solution for Microsoft, which at the time was one of the largest data warehouses not on a mainframe â€“ an example of high volume. Iâ€™ve worked on a 99.999% high availability solution for NASDAQ that offloaded quotes from the mainframe to WinTel server â€“ example of high velocity.</p>
